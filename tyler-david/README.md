## Overview
<!-- As a user I am looking for a site that will display my blog articles clearly and logically so I can find things in them quickly and so they are easy to read in an order of most recent artcicles first.
As a developer I am using jquerys library to crete a functionl effecient way to traverse, access, and manipulate the DOM.  As a developer I also want my code to be dry as possible.  Optimize iteration with JavaScript array methods, this helps keep my coder more condensed and maintainable..-->

## Getting Started
